## Who's At Work? 
This repo hosts the arduino source code files for our DESN2010 project. 

## Requirements to run
You will need to have an `arduino\_secrets.h` file which defines the `SECRET_SSID` and `SECRET_PASS` constants. These are the SSID and password for your local wifi connection. 

## How does it work? 
Details to come.
